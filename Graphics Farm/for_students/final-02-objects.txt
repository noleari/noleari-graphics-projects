(Required) Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. Apiary-0 - An apiary with apiary boxes and bees swarming the apiary
    Includes: Bee object, ApiaryBox object, GrassField object
    Bee object- Textured bee made out of primitives
    (body: stripes texture)
    ApiaryBox object - Textured box object made to represent an apiary box
    (box: smooth wood plank texture)
2. Grass-12 - A field of grass written with a custom shader pair so the grass moves over time as if there is wind

(Required) Five other kinds of objects that you created (possibly in previous assignments):
3. Bus-0 - Simple bus with a textured side made out of bufferGeometry (From wb08)
    (sides: windows texture)
4. GableHouse-0 - Simple house with textured front and roof (From wb08) 
    (front: door and windows texture, roof: shingle texture)
5. Cornfield - A field of corn with sparse grass below
    Includes: GrassField object, Corn.glb model (Attribution below)
6. Silo - A textured structure made out of primitives to represent a silo
    (base: corrugated metal texture, top: white metal texture)
7. TractorShed - A textured structure made out of primitives to hold a tractor
    (posts: wood texture, ground: gravel texture, roof: shingle texture)

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
8. Tractor - Static tractor model from web (Attribution below)
9. FlatHipHouse-0 - Shed with textured roof and front (From wb08, modified to look like a shed)
    (front: shed front texture, roof: shingle texture);
10. Mailbox-0 - Simple textured mailbox made out of primitives
    (base post: wood texture)
11. Treeline - Treeline to separate cornfield and apiary, made out of Tree.glb models (Attribution below)
12. Fence - Fences surrounding the farm, made out of many textured fence objects I created
    (posts: wood texture)
13. gravel-road - Gravel road made out of plane geometries with texture & normal map for bus to drive on
    (ground: gravel road texture, normal map: rockRoadNormal.jpg)
14. Billboard - Textured billboard made out of primitives
    (posts: wood texture, sign: custom drawn farm sign)
15. AnimationWoman - Animated imported model of a woman who walks out from the bus into the house on loop (Attribution below)
16. Farmer - Animated imported model of a farmer that user can control with WASD keys
